// Byte-compatibility proof: this vault blob was produced by wharf-tui's Go
// `internal/vault` package (real DefaultParams: argon2id t=3, m=64MiB, p=4).
// If the TypeScript port unlocks it via BOTH slots and recovers the exact
// payload, the formats are byte-for-byte compatible: same header layout, same
// argon2id output at parallelism 4, same XChaCha20-Poly1305 sealing with the
// header as AAD, and the same Crockford recovery-code decoding.
